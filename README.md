### The result is sometime unstable, it depends the first random value Pytorch gives.
### Therefore, you will get full points if we can see your loss keep dropping.
### Please try to train several time if you are getting the same loss values.

Please go through the YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHdlXe1bSe4&t=1256s
and Reproduce the code in the video. 
However, please change the architecture to the one enclosed (Architecture.png).
There are several tasks:
1. Use gradient descent to find all the parameters in the architecture
2. Change the inputs and labels
3. The result of your program should be like result.png

hint: Please use total_loss to do the backpropagation, or you will not be able to update the parameters
